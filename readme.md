# LadyPHP - type PHP with elegance

Simple (and stupid) preprocessor for PHP. Main purpose of this is making a source code a little more beautiful.

- optional `;` at end of line
- variables are not prefixed with `$` and starts with lowercase letter
- indent style (2 spaces), no need for `{` and `}`
- original line numbers are preserved (handy for debugging)
- Lady herself is written in Lady, use the source for reference

## Example

#### LadyPHP

    <?

    class Fruit
      var apples = 0

      function addApples(n = 1)
        this->apples += n

      function countApples()
        out = 'You have ' . this->apples
        if (this->apples == 1)
          return out . ' apple.'
        else
          return out . ' apples.'

    fruit = new Fruit
    fruit->addApples(3)
    print fruit->countApples()

#### PHP


    <?php # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. It was generated by LadyPHP.

    class Fruit{
      var $apples = 0;

      function addApples($n = 1){
        $this->apples += $n;}

      function countApples(){
        $out = 'You have ' . $this->apples;
        if ($this->apples == 1){
          return $out . ' apple.';}
        else{
          return $out . ' apples.';}}}

    $fruit = new Fruit;
    $fruit->addApples(3);
    print $fruit->countApples();

## Usage

    <?php
    require_once('lady.php');
    $php = Lady::parseFile('example.lady');

## What doesn't works

- multiline comments and inline html doesn't works
