# LadyPHP - type PHP with elegance

Simple (and stupid) preprocessor for PHP. Main purpose of this is making a source code a little more beautiful.

- optional `;` at end of line
- variables doesn't has to be prefixed with `$`, but it must starts with a lowercase letter
- indent style (2 spaces), no need for `{` and `}`
- `.` is converted to `->`, but not if it's surrounded by spaces
- `fn foo()` is converted to `function foo()`
- `Foo()` is converted to `new Foo()`
- original line numbers are preserved (handy for debugging)
- Lady herself is written in Lady, use the source for reference

## Example



#### LadyPHP

    <?

    class Fruit
      var apples = 0

      fn addApples(n = 1)
        this.apples += n
        return this

      fn countApples()
        out = 'You have ' . this.apples
        if (this.apples == 1)
          return out . ' apple.'
        else
          return "$out apples."

    fruit = Fruit()
    fruit.addApples(3)
         .addApples(2)
    print fruit.countApples()

#### PHP

    <?php # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. It was generated by LadyPHP.

    class Fruit{
      var $apples = 0;

      function addApples($n = 1){
        $this->apples += $n;
        return $this;}

      function countApples(){
        $out = 'You have ' . $this->apples;
        if ($this->apples == 1){
          return $out . ' apple.';}
        else{
          return "$out apples.";}}}

    $fruit = new Fruit();
    $fruit->addApples(3)
         ->addApples(2);
    print $fruit->countApples();

#### Output

    You have 5 apples.

## Usage

    <?php
    require_once('lady.php');
    $php = Lady::parseFile('example.lady');

## What doesn't works

- multiline comments and inline html
- switch block
- namespaces (`new` is not added before `Foo\Bar()`)
